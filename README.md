# Salary Calculator

The Salary Calculator application records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. The form has inputs that collect an employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. The `Submit` button collects the form information, stores it to calculate monthly costs, appends the information to the DOM, and clears the input fields. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background color is added to the total monthly cost. The `Remove` button removes an employee from the DOM and also updates the total monthly cost.
